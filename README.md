# MIT 2025 Pokerbots Competition Submission

**Status:** *In Progress*  
_Code will be posted after the conclusion of the competition._

This repository contains the code for my team's submission to the **MIT 2025 Pokerbots Competition**. We are currently experimenting with two different strategies to optimize performance:

## Strategies

1. **Rules-Based Strategy**
   - Utilizes deep poker theory and Game Theory Optimal (GTO)-based approaches.
   - Focuses on addressing heads-up situations within broad strategic umbrellas.

2. **Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR)**
   - Implements reinforcement learning to determine optimal actions.
   - Leverages a large decision tree, iteratively learning and minimizing regret for each decision to identify the best possible action.

Stay tuned for updates and the final code after the competition wraps up!
